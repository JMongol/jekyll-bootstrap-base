## Jekyll Bootstrap Base ##
This is a basic Jekyll site that is set up for:

 * Bootstrap
 * JS and CSS minimization and compression via the Jekyll Asset Pipeline gem
 * Deployment to Amazon S3
 * A "more" view on blog posts.

Most of this was inspired by other public Jekyll repositories, and I put it together mainly for my use in getting new Jekyll sites up and running quickly.
